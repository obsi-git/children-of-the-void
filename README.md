A 2D metroidvania platformer game developed using the Unity Engine, using C# for scripting.
A sidescroller similar to games like Hollow Knight or Dead Cells with a player and a demo boss. 

### How to play?
Download the executable and run on your PC!

3. Jump using Spacebar
4. Dash using Right Mouse Button
5. Dodge Roll using Left Ctrl 
6. Wallslide by jumping against a wall and holding the movement key against the wall
