## Children of the Void 

A metroidvania platformer game with hack and slash elements and a minimalist setting, in which you traverse a desolate and broken land corrupted by a malicious and unknown power known only as The Void. Players will be able to harness the power of the Void, but too much of it will negatively impact the player. I aim to create a story and plot driven game with a few concepts that drive the story forward, and a small progression system for the player.
